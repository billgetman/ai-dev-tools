I'm giving a presentation on ai development tools like claude code, for developers.

I work at Deepgram, the engineers I work with are good at what they do, but have been critical of ai tools in the past.

I am not a classical engineer, but need to be able to solve each track within 20-25 minutes with an agentic coder.

The goal of each of the tracks is to help devs understand the limits and role of the tools and know how to explore and deploy when needed.

There are three tracks; rust, elm, and python.

Each track will have a greenfield, brownfield, and supporting documentation.

Greenfield and brownfield projects should be part of the same codebase.

Each project should be loosely tied to deepgram's work, but should be fun-ish.

Each project cannot be solved easily without proper context layering for the ai.
